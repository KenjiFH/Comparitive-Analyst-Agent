For the Period Ended September 30, 2025

HEADQUARTERS: San Francisco, California
TICKER: APX

--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---

Apex Technologies Inc. ("Apex" or the "Company") today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The Company delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, driven primarily by the accelerated adoption of our Nucleus AI Cloud platform and resilient demand for enterprise software solutions. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by elevated interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, Apex has maintained its trajectory of profitable growth while continuing to invest aggressively in next-generation generative AI capabilities.

"We are witnessing a generational shift in how enterprises compute," said Elena Rostova, Chief Executive Officer of Apex Technologies. "Our third-quarter results validate our strategy of unifying data infrastructure with proprietary machine learning models. We are seeing unprecedented demand for our GPU-accelerated instances, and our retention rates remain at industry-leading levels. However, we remain vigilant regarding cost structures and are optimizing our workforce to align with our highest priority strategic initiatives."

--- FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS ---

Total Revenue for the third quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year. This growth was largely fueled by the Cloud Services segment, which grew 24% to $2.8 billion. 
Operating Income was $850 million, representing an operating margin of 20.2%, compared to 19.5% in the same period last year.
Net Income GAAP was $620 million, or $1.45 per diluted share.
Free Cash Flow generated in the quarter was $980 million, allowing the Company to repurchase $500 million of common stock under its authorized buyback program.

--- OPERATIONAL REVIEW ---

Segment Performance:
1. Cloud & AI Infrastructure: Revenue of $2.8 billion. The launch of the 'Apex Tensor Cluster' has exceeded internal expectations, with capacity fully booked through Q1 2026. However, deployment timelines have been elongated due to supply constraints.
2. Enterprise SaaS: Revenue of $1.4 billion. Growth moderated to 8% year-over-year as small-to-medium business (SMB) customers scrutinized IT budgets. Churn in the SMB segment increased by 50 basis points to 4.5%.

--- RISK FACTORS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ---

Investors should carefully consider the following risks:

Supply Chain & Hardware Constraints: Our ability to meet the demand for AI compute is heavily dependent on the availability of high-performance GPUs and advanced memory chips. We are currently facing a significant shortage of H100-class components from our primary suppliers. If these shortages persist beyond Q4 2025, our revenue growth in the Cloud segment will be materially impacted.

Regulatory & Antitrust Scrutiny: Apex is currently subject to an ongoing investigation by the European Commission regarding potential anti-competitive practices in our cloud marketplace. While we believe our practices are lawful, an adverse ruling could result in substantial fines (up to 10% of global turnover) and forced structural changes to our business model.

Cybersecurity: As a custodian of sensitive enterprise data, we face constant threats from state-sponsored actors. A significant breach could erode customer trust and lead to material liability.

--- MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY & OUTLOOK ---

CFO Marcus Thorne added, "We are raising our full-year guidance based on the strength of our enterprise pipeline. We now expect total fiscal year revenue to be in the range of $16.5 billion to $16.8 billion. Capital expenditures will increase in Q4 as we break ground on two new data centers in Northern Virginia and Ireland."

The Company expects Q4 revenue to be between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion. We anticipate operating margins to compress slightly to 19% due to holiday-related marketing spend and R&D bonuses.
