(All figures in USD unless otherwise noted; unaudited; fictional)

Company Overview and Reporting Scope

Aurora Ridge Technologies, Inc. (“Aurora Ridge,” “the Company,” or “ARTI”) is a mid-stage technology and services company operating primarily in the areas of cloud infrastructure tooling, applied analytics, and managed enterprise integrations. The Company serves customers across North America and parts of Western Europe, with a growing footprint in the Asia-Pacific region.

This consolidated financial statement reflects the financial position and operating results of Aurora Ridge Technologies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including RidgeCloud LLC and Aurora Data Services GmbH. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The reporting period covers the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, with comparative references to the prior fiscal year where relevant.

Management believes the presentation below fairly represents the Company’s financial condition, subject to the limitations and forward-looking risks described herein.

Revenue Performance and Composition

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, Aurora Ridge reported total consolidated revenue of approximately $428.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of roughly 17.9% compared to fiscal year 2024. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased enterprise subscription adoption and expansion within existing customer accounts.

Key revenue drivers included:

Subscription-based software licenses, which accounted for approximately 61% of total revenue, reflecting continued migration of legacy customers to multi-year cloud agreements.

Professional and implementation services, contributing approximately 24% of total revenue, with growth moderated by capacity constraints in Q3.

Usage-based data processing and analytics fees, making up the remaining 15%, showing higher volatility due to customer demand variability.

Revenue concentration remained moderate, with the Company’s top five customers accounting for approximately 18% of total revenue, down from 22% in the prior year. No single customer represented more than 6% of total revenue during the reporting period.

Management notes that while headline revenue growth remained strong, average contract value growth decelerated slightly in the second half of the year, particularly among mid-market customers.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Analysis

Total cost of revenue for fiscal year 2025 was approximately $211.4 million, resulting in a consolidated gross profit of $217.2 million and an overall gross margin of approximately 50.7%, compared to 52.1% in fiscal year 2024.

Cost of revenue consisted primarily of:

Cloud infrastructure hosting fees paid to third-party providers.

Salaries and benefits for customer support and implementation personnel.

Depreciation of internally developed software platforms.

Licensing fees associated with third-party integrations.

Gross margin compression during the year was attributable to a combination of factors, including higher cloud compute costs, temporary overstaffing in support functions following a Q2 hiring initiative, and increased reliance on external contractors during peak implementation periods.

Management expects margin stabilization in fiscal year 2026 as infrastructure optimization initiatives mature and workforce planning aligns more closely with forecasted demand.

Operating Expenses and Cost Structure

Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2025 amounted to approximately $238.9 million, representing 55.7% of total revenue. This compares to 54.2% in the prior year.

Operating expenses were composed of the following major categories:

Research and development expenses totaling approximately $96.3 million, reflecting continued investment in platform scalability, AI-assisted analytics features, and security enhancements.

Sales and marketing expenses of approximately $87.5 million, including personnel costs, customer acquisition programs, and increased spending on enterprise account-based marketing.

General and administrative expenses totaling approximately $55.1 million, driven by legal, compliance, insurance, and executive compensation costs.

Notably, R&D expenses increased by approximately 21% year-over-year, outpacing revenue growth. Management considers this investment strategic, though acknowledges near-term pressure on operating margins.

Operating Income, Losses, and Adjustments

Aurora Ridge reported an operating loss of approximately $21.7 million for fiscal year 2025, compared to an operating loss of $9.4 million in fiscal year 2024.

This widening operating loss was influenced by:

Elevated R&D and go-to-market investments.

One-time restructuring costs of approximately $6.8 million related to the consolidation of European operations.

Increased stock-based compensation expense totaling approximately $18.2 million, up from $11.9 million in the prior year.

Excluding restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, management estimates adjusted operating income would have been approximately $3.4 million, though such non-GAAP measures should be interpreted cautiously.

Other Income, Interest, and Tax Considerations

Other income and expense items resulted in a net expense of approximately $9.6 million, consisting primarily of:

Interest expense of approximately $12.1 million related to the Company’s senior secured credit facility.

Interest income of approximately $2.9 million from short-term investments and cash equivalents.

Foreign exchange losses of approximately $0.4 million, primarily associated with EUR-denominated receivables.

The Company recorded a nominal income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 million, reflecting deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses. Aurora Ridge continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income.

Net Loss and Earnings Profile

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, Aurora Ridge reported a consolidated net loss of approximately $30.1 million, compared to a net loss of $15.8 million in fiscal year 2024.

Basic and diluted net loss per share was approximately $(0.84), based on a weighted average of approximately 35.9 million shares outstanding during the period.

Management emphasizes that near-term profitability is not the primary strategic objective, citing long-term platform differentiation and market expansion as key priorities.

Cash Flow and Liquidity Position

Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2025 was approximately $12.6 million, an improvement from $19.4 million in the prior year, reflecting improved working capital management and deferred revenue growth.

Key cash flow observations include:

Net cash used in investing activities of approximately $24.3 million, primarily related to capitalized software development costs and infrastructure investments.

Net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $48.7 million, largely driven by a Series D equity financing completed in May 2025.

As of December 31, 2025, the Company held approximately $96.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, with an additional $18.0 million available under its revolving credit facility.

Management believes existing liquidity is sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 18 months under current assumptions.

Balance Sheet Highlights

At December 31, 2025, Aurora Ridge reported total assets of approximately $612.8 million, including:

Cash and cash equivalents of approximately $96.2 million.

Accounts receivable of approximately $72.4 million, net of allowances.

Capitalized software and intangible assets totaling approximately $289.6 million.

Total liabilities were approximately $387.5 million, consisting primarily of long-term debt, deferred revenue, and accrued expenses. Stockholders’ equity totaled approximately $225.3 million.

The Company’s debt-to-equity ratio increased modestly during the year, reflecting new borrowings associated with infrastructure expansion.
