GREENFIELD POWER & INFRASTRUCTURE
INVESTOR UPDATE - RENEWABLE TRANSITION PROGRESS
Date: October 15, 2025

HEADQUARTERS: Austin, Texas
TICKER: GPWR

--- COMPANY PROFILE ---

GreenField Power is a diversified energy holding company serving 3.5 million customers across the Sun Belt region. The Company is midway through its "Vision 2030" strategy to retire coal-fired generation assets and replace them with solar, wind, and battery storage utility-scale projects.

--- EXECUTIVE STATEMENT ---

"The energy transition is no longer a theoretical goal; it is an operational reality," remarked Dr. Amara Singh, President and CEO. "This quarter, we successfully connected the 'Helios II' solar farm to the ERCOT grid, adding 1.2 gigawatts of capacity. While we are proud of this engineering marvel, we face headwinds from a volatile regulatory environment and rising capital costs. Our commitment to decarbonization remains steadfast, but we must balance this with affordability for our rate-payers."

--- FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (YTD) ---

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025:
Total Revenue (Operating Revenues) reached $12.4 billion, up 6% from the prior year period, driven by extreme summer temperatures and increased load from data center customers.
Net Income Attributable to GreenField was $1.1 billion.
Capital Expenditures (CapEx) totaled $4.5 billion, with 85% allocated to renewable generation and transmission upgrades.
Dividend: The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share, consistent with our target payout ratio of 65%.

--- OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS ---

Renewable Portfolio:
Renewables now account for 42% of our total generation mix, up from 35% in 2024. The retirement of the 'Carbon Creek' coal facility has been accelerated to December 2026.

Grid Reliability:
We invested $800 million YTD in grid hardening to protect against extreme weather events. System reliability metrics (SAIDI/SAIFI) improved by 15% compared to the 2024 baseline.

--- RISK FACTORS ---

Regulatory & Legislative Changes:
Our business model relies heavily on federal Production Tax Credits (PTCs) and Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) provided by the Inflation Reduction Act. There is active political debate in Washington regarding the repeal or reduction of these credits. If the legislative framework changes unfavorably, the ROI on our $10 billion renewable pipeline would be materially reduced, potentially forcing project cancellations.

Interest Rate Sensitivity:
GreenField Power carries significant debt ($18 billion) to finance infrastructure projects. While 70% of our debt is fixed-rate, our floating-rate exposure combined with the need to refinance $2 billion in maturing bonds in 2026 presents a risk. If interest rates remain "higher for longer," our interest expense will increase, pressuring earnings and potentially impacting our credit rating.

Project Execution & Permitting:
We are experiencing significant delays in obtaining interconnection approvals from regional transmission organizations. The current backlog for interconnection is averaging 24 months, which delays revenue recognition for completed solar projects.

--- FUTURE OUTLOOK ---

Management reaffirms its long-term EPS growth target of 5-7%. We expect to file a new general rate case with the Public Utility Commission in Q1 2026 to recover costs associated with grid modernization. We anticipate closing the fiscal year with total revenue of approximately $15.8 billion.
