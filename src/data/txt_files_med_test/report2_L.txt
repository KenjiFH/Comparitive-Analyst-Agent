--- OVERVIEW ---

OmniMarkets Global Group ("OmniMarkets"), a leading multinational retailer operating 4,500 stores across North America and Europe, reports its preliminary financial results for the fiscal year 2025. The year was defined by significant volatility in consumer spending patterns, persistent inflationary pressures on inventory costs, and a strategic pivot toward our 'Digital-First' omnichannel model. While top-line revenue remained resilient, profitability was impacted by rising labor costs and shrinkage (theft).

David Chen, CEO of OmniMarkets, stated in the letter to shareholders: "2025 was a year of necessary transformation. We made the difficult decision to close 150 underperforming locations to redirect capital toward our e-commerce fulfillment network. While these choices impacted short-term earnings, they position OmniMarkets for long-term sustainability. Our customer base is feeling the pressure of inflation, and we are committed to maintaining price leadership on essential goods, even at the expense of margin."

--- FINANCIAL SUMMARY ---

Consolidated Revenue for the fiscal year was $88.5 billion, a flat performance compared to $88.2 billion in 2024. Same-store sales (excluding fuel) decreased by 1.2%.
Gross Margin contracted by 120 basis points to 22.8%, driven primarily by higher vendor pricing and increased promotional activity required to clear discretionary inventory.
Net Loss for the year was $(250) million, inclusive of $1.1 billion in one-time restructuring charges related to store closures and severance. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion.
Inventory levels at year-end were $12.5 billion, down 8% from the prior year, reflecting successful destocking efforts.

--- OPERATIONAL UPDATES ---

E-Commerce Transformation:
Digital sales grew 15% year-over-year, now representing 12% of total revenue. The launch of 'Omni+ Membership' has garnered 5 million subscribers, driving higher frequency in basket size.

Store Optimization:
The company completed the closure of 45 "Red Flag" locations in Q4 alone. We have renegotiated leases on another 200 properties to lower fixed costs.

--- KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ---

Labor Relations and Unionization: We are currently in contentious contract negotiations with the United Distribution Workers (UDW) union, representing 40,000 of our logistics employees. The union has authorized a strike vote if an agreement is not reached by February 28, 2026. A work stoppage would paralyze our supply chain and cause material harm to Q1 2026 financial results.

Inflationary Pressure on Consumers: Our core demographic consists of low-to-middle-income households who are disproportionately affected by inflation. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains elevated, we anticipate further trade-down behavior and reduced basket sizes for high-margin discretionary items (electronics, apparel).

Shrinkage and Theft: Organized retail crime continues to be a severe headwind, reducing gross margin by an estimated 0.8%. We are investing $200 million in advanced security measures, but there is no guarantee these will be effective.

--- 2026 GUIDANCE ---

Looking ahead to 2026, management is taking a conservative stance. We project full-year revenue to decline slightly to a range of $86.0 billion to $87.5 billion as we annualize store closures. However, we expect profitability to improve, forecasting Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.50 to $2.80.

"We are streamlining the ship," added CFO Sarah Jenkins. "2026 will be about operational efficiency and cash flow generation, not expansion."
